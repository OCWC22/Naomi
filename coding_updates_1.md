## 04-19-2025 - Added .gitignore file

### Files Updated:
- `/Users/chen/Desktop/Projects/Naomi/.gitignore`: Created file and added `.DS_Store`

### Description:
Created a `.gitignore` file to prevent macOS system files (`.DS_Store`) from being tracked by Git.

### Reasoning:
`.DS_Store` files are specific to macOS Finder and contain folder view options. They are not relevant to the project's code or functionality and should not be committed to the repository.

### Trade-offs:
- None. Ignoring these files is standard practice.

### Considerations:
- Ensures a cleaner Git history by excluding system-specific metadata.

### Future Work:
- Consider adding other common entries to `.gitignore` (e.g., `node_modules`, environment files, build outputs) as the project evolves.

## 04-19-2025 - Refactored PRD for Hackathon MVP (WhatsApp, Pinecone, Mem0)

### Files Updated:
- `/Users/chen/Desktop/Projects/Naomi/prd.md`: Rewritten for MVP scope and new tech stack.

### Description:
Updated the Product Requirements Document (PRD) to reflect a simplified MVP scope for the hackathon. Shifted primary user interaction to WhatsApp via the Cloud API, replacing the previous web-centric approach and Google ADK focus. Integrated Pinecone for vector storage and Mem0 for shared agent memory.

### Reasoning:
Based on the user request to pivot to a focused MVP using WhatsApp (representing the MCP interaction model), Pinecone, and Mem0, suitable for a hackathon. This necessitated simplifying features (removing explicit logins, reducing UI complexity), changing the core interaction model to WhatsApp-first, and updating the technology stack based on researched documentation (as of April 2025).

### Trade-offs:
- Reduced initial feature set for faster development and feasibility within hackathon constraints.
- Increased reliance on the specified external APIs (WhatsApp Cloud API, Pinecone, Mem0).
- Web client becomes a purely passive display, limiting direct user interaction possibilities in the MVP.

### Considerations:
- Secure management of API credentials for WhatsApp, Pinecone, and potentially Mem0 is crucial.
- Backend requires robust handling of asynchronous WhatsApp webhooks and agent orchestration.
- A mechanism for pushing updates from the backend to the passive web client (e.g., WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, or simple polling for MVP) will be needed.

### Future Work:
- Post-hackathon, explore richer web client interactions.
- Expand agent capabilities and analysis depth.
- Implement more sophisticated error handling and user feedback within WhatsApp.
- Evaluate needs for more persistent storage beyond Mem0's scope if required.

## 04-19-2025 - Created FastAPI Backend Structure for WhatsApp MCP (Python Component)

### Files Updated:
- `/Users/chen/Desktop/Projects/Naomi/main.py`: Created basic FastAPI app structure.
- `/Users/chen/Desktop/Projects/Naomi/mcp_tools/__init__.py`: Created empty init file.
- `/Users/chen/Desktop/Projects/Naomi/requirements.txt`: Added FastAPI and Uvicorn dependencies.

### Description:
Initialized the Python backend structure using FastAPI, intended to act as the MCP server component based on the architecture of `lharries/whatsapp-mcp`. This component will provide MCP tool endpoints for interaction with an LLM.

### Reasoning:
Following user instruction to use the MCP approach from the provided GitHub repository (`lharries/whatsapp-mcp`) and FastAPI for the backend, explicitly avoiding the official WhatsApp Cloud API. This structure provides the foundation for the Python part of that architecture.

### Trade-offs:
- **High Risk:** This approach relies on the unofficial WhatsApp Web API via the `whatsmeow` library (used by the separate required Go bridge), which is unstable and potentially violates WhatsApp ToS.
- **Dependency:** This Python server is *only one part* of the required system; it depends entirely on a separate Go `whatsapp-bridge` component (not yet built) to function.
- **Deviation:** This significantly deviates from the previously agreed PRD (v3) which specified the official WhatsApp Cloud API. PRD update is recommended.

### Considerations:
- A communication mechanism (e.g., HTTP requests, gRPC) between this Python FastAPI server and the Go bridge needs to be designed and implemented.
- Error handling for communication failures with the Go bridge is crucial.
- The specific MCP tool endpoints required by the agents (`ConversationDebugAgent`, `ResponseDrafterAgent`) need to be implemented.
- **Security implications** of using unofficial APIs and storing/handling WhatsApp data locally via the Go bridge must be carefully considered.

### Future Work:
- Implement MCP tool endpoints in `main.py`.
- Define and implement the communication protocol with the Go bridge.
- Build or adapt the Go `whatsapp-bridge` component.
- Integrate Mem0 and Pinecone logic within the MCP tool implementations.
- Update `prd.md` to reflect this architectural change and the use of the unofficial API.

## 04-19-2025 - Corrected PRD to WhatsApp MCP Architecture

### Files Updated:
- `/Users/chen/Desktop/Projects/Naomi/prd.md`: Rewritten to accurately reflect the MCP (Go Bridge + Python Server) architecture, removing Cloud API details.

### Description:
Corrected the PRD (version 4) to fully align with the user's decision to use the WhatsApp MCP approach (inspired by `lharries/whatsapp-mcp`) instead of the official WhatsApp Cloud API. Removed all references to the Cloud API, webhooks, and associated concepts. Detailed the two-component architecture (Go Bridge using `whatsmeow` + Python MCP Server using FastAPI), updated the tech stack, interaction model (QR code setup, MCP tool calls), and added necessary disclaimers about using unofficial APIs.

### Reasoning:
To accurately document the project's chosen architecture based on explicit user direction, rectifying the previous version (v3) which incorrectly retained Cloud API elements after the decision to switch to the MCP model. This ensures the PRD serves as a correct guide for development using the unofficial WhatsApp Web API via a bridge.

### Trade-offs:
- (Same as previous update, now correctly documented in PRD) **High Risk:** Relies on unstable, unofficial WhatsApp Web API via `whatsmeow`. Potential ToS violation.
- **Dependency:** Python server requires a separate Go bridge component.
- Functionality is now tied to a personal WhatsApp account, not the Business Platform.

### Considerations:
- (Same as previous update) Communication protocol between Go bridge and Python server is critical. Security and stability of the `whatsmeow` integration are major concerns. Need to define how agents/tools invoke MCP endpoints.

### Future Work:
- Implement MCP tool endpoints in `main.py`.
- Define and implement the Go Bridge <-> Python Server communication.
- Build/Adapt the Go `whatsapp-bridge`.
- Integrate Mem0 and Pinecone.
- Define the primary user/agent interaction mechanism with the MCP server.

## 04-19-2025 - Added Reference Doc for WhatsApp MCP QR Code (Node.js Example)

### Files Updated:
- `/Users/chen/Desktop/Projects/Naomi/reference/feature-whatsapp-mcp-qr.md`: Created new reference file.

### Description:
Added a reference document detailing a potential implementation for the WhatsApp MCP QR code generation and authentication check features. This specific example uses Node.js and the `whatsapp-web.js` library.

### Reasoning:
Created by the user to provide technical reference material for implementing the WhatsApp connection part of the MCP architecture (the "Bridge" component). This file outlines one possible approach using Node.js, which could inform the development of the Go bridge (or potentially serve as an alternative implementation path).

### Trade-offs:
- Introduces a Node.js/`whatsapp-web.js` implementation example, which differs from the Go/`whatsmeow` approach used in the original `lharries/whatsapp-mcp` reference. This adds another option but requires a decision on the bridge implementation technology.
- Both `whatsapp-web.js` and `whatsmeow` are unofficial libraries with associated risks (instability, ToS violation).

### Considerations:
- This file is located in the `/reference` directory and serves as read-only context.
- The project must decide whether to build the bridge component in Go (using `whatsmeow`) or Node.js (using `whatsapp-web.js`), or another language/library. This reference document provides specific guidance for the Node.js path.
- The core dependency on a separate bridge component and the risks of using unofficial APIs remain regardless of the specific library chosen.

### Future Work:
- Decide on the language/library for the WhatsApp Bridge component (e.g., Go/`whatsmeow` vs. Node.js/`whatsapp-web.js`).
- Build or adapt the Bridge component based on the chosen technology, potentially using this reference file.
- Ensure the chosen Bridge implementation provides the necessary API for the Python FastAPI MCP server to consume.
